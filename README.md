# Matrix Text animation

This repository is a simple text animation I use in my videos.

## Getting started

It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) so you'll need to have it installed.

Install dependencies

```sh
$ bun install
```

Launch the app

```sh
$ bun run dev
```

It should also work fine with the standard `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` so use them if you wish.
